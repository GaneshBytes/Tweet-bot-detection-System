Key features include:

Data preprocessing and feature extraction from Twitter datasets

Machine learning models for bot classification

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Scalable approach that can be extended to real-time social media monitoring

Applications:
Social media analysis, misinformation detection, spam filtering, and digital trust systems.
